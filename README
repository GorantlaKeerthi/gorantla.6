To compile we used the make command 
$ make
we will get like this. 
 gcc -Wall -g -c proc.c
gcc -Wall -g -c clock.c
gcc -Wall -g -c shm.c
gcc -Wall -g oss.c proc.o clock.o shm.o -o oss -lrt -pthread
gcc -Wall -g user.c proc.o clock.o shm.o -o user -lrt -pthread

After compilation we can find oss file which will be green color. 
2. Execute To execute the program use command ./oss we will get output in output.txt 
By comparing page replacement  algorithm  on  both  of  the  different  pagerequest schemes, 
first one is more therotical and ideal but second method which is requesting with basis of a weightage is preferbale in my opinion, 
because it is more applicable in real time scenarios inside an operating system

Version Control: I pushed all these files in to github. /classes/OS/gorantla/gorantla.6/log
